# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on patient health data. It explores various classification models, evaluates their performance, and fine-tunes hyperparameters for better accuracy.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
âœ… Data visualization and exploratory analysis  
âœ… Implementation of multiple classification models  
âœ… Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV  
âœ… Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves  
âœ… Cross-validation for robust model performance  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest
